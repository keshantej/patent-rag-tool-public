# Patent RAG Tool (Public Demo Layer)

A legal research tool for U.S. patent law, built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.  
This demo showcases a simplified version of a system designed to deliver grounded, citation-rich answers using:

- The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP)
- Title 35 U.S.C. (Patent Statutes)
- Title 37 CFR (Patent Regulations)

## üîç About This Project

This public repo includes the core architecture and components behind the tool.  
Some components‚Äîsuch as the full routing engine, dynamic prompt construction, and document preprocessing pipeline‚Äîare part of a more complete and private version of this tool. These features include statute-aware expansion, custom reranking logic, and citation-preserving chunking. While omitted from this public demo, they can be made available for academic evaluation, technical review, or collaborative discussions upon request.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features (Public Version)

- **Query Classification**: Distinguishes statute lookups, fact patterns, and claim-specific questions
- **Section-Aware Retrieval**: Switches between semantic and direct retrieval based on query type
- **Citation Tagging**: Adds inline references to [MPEP ¬ß], [CFR ¬ß], and [35 U.S.C. ¬ß]
- **Hyperlinked Citations**: Outputs include direct links to relevant legal sources
- **Basic Query Rewriting**: Uses LLMs to refine legal questions for better retrieval
- **Embedding Layer**: Supports OpenAI and SentenceTransformers with local caching
- **FastAPI Interface**: Simple legal QA endpoint
- **Web UI**: Tailwind-based frontend with Markdown rendering and citation memory

## üìö Legal Corpus

- **MPEP**: Chapters 100‚Äì2900 (Eligibility, Appeals, Rejections, etc.)
- **Title 35**: Patent statutes including ¬ß¬ß101, 102, 103, 112
- **Title 37 CFR**: USPTO‚Äôs rules of practice
- **Claim Rules & Fees**: Dedicated section for claims, dependencies, and filing costs

> The full version includes this corpus as well as a modular scraping tool in the case of updates.

## üß† Embedding Logic

Includes a public version of the custom `OpenAIDocumentEmbedder`:

- Built with Haystack decorators
- Adds metadata like section titles and IDs
- Local hash-based caching to avoid duplicate API calls

> The full version includes reranker logic and additional retrieval layers.
