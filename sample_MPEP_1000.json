The present Chapter deals with the latter two items. The line of demarcation between appealable matters for the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) and petitionable matters for the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Director) should be carefully observed. The Board will not ordinarily hear a question that should be decided by the Director on petition, and the Director will not ordinarily entertain a petition where the question presented is a matter appealable to the Board. See MPEP Chapter 1200 for more information on appealable matters. 37 CFR 1.181(g) states, \"The Director may delegate to appropriate Patent and Trademark Office officials the determination of petitions.\" The various delegations to various Office officials are set forth in this Chapter. The delegations set forth in this Chapter do not confer a right to have a matter decided by a specific\u00a0Office official, rather, such delegations aid in the efficient treatment of petitions by the Office. A delegation of supervisory or higher level review authority over a matter carries with it the authority to decide the matter ab initio.",

Any petition under this section must be accompanied by the petition fee set forth in \u00c2\u00a71.17(f). Petitions on appealable matters ordinarily are not entertained. SeeMPEP \u00c2\u00a7 1201. A petition should include:\n\n1. A statement of the type of relief requested and the authorizing provision of statute or rules, if applicable;\n\n2. A statement of the relevant facts;\n\n3. An identification of the points that are to be reviewed; and\n\n4. The fee, where required. 37 CFR 1.4(c)requires a separate petition for each distinct subject, inquiry or order to avoid confusion and delay in answering the petition. Therefore, each petition should ordinarily only be filed under a single authorizing provision (e.g.,37 CFR 1.181). Although concurrent petitions seeking relief from the same action may be filed, many prior petitioners have benefitted by delaying the filing of petitions under37 CFR 1.182or1.183until after they receive a decision on a petition seeking supervisory review under37 CFR 1.181. The mere filing of a petition will not stay the period for replying to an examiner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action which may be running against an application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings (37 CFR 1.181(f)). For example, if a petition to vacate a final rejection as premature is filed within 2 months from the date of the final rejection, the period for reply to the final rejection is not extended even if the petition is not reached for decision within that period. However, if the petition is granted and the applicant has filed an otherwise full reply to the rejection within the period for reply, the case is not abandoned.",

However, if the petition is granted and the applicant has filed an otherwise full reply to the rejection within the period for reply, the case is not abandoned.\n\n37 CFR 1.181(f)provides that any petition under that rule which is not filed \"within two months of the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested may be dismissed as untimely.\" Often, the \"action or notice from which relief is requested,\" for example, a requirement for a new drawing, is included in the same letter as an action on the merits of the claims, the latter having a 3-month period for reply. Under such circumstances, if applicant requests reconsideration, under37 CFR 1.111(b), of the requirement for a new drawing, the examiner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action on this request, if adverse, establishes the beginning of the 2-month period for filing the petition. The petition must be filed within this period even though the period for reply to the rejection of the claims may extend beyond the 2-month period. The 2-month period for filing timely petitions set forth in37 CFR 1.181(f)applies to any petition under 37 CFR part 1, except as otherwise provided. A number of sections (e.g.,37 CFR 1.377,1.378, and1.740) specify the time period within which a petition must be filed (or may be dismissed as untimely). The 2-month time period in37 CFR 1.181(f)applies to a petition under any section (e.g.,37 CFR 1.182and37 CFR 1.183) that does not specify the time period within which a petition must be filed. The 2-month period is not extendible under 37\u00a0CFR 1.136(a) since the time is within the discretion of the Director of the USPTO. 37 CFR 1.181(f)authorizes deciding officials to reasonably exercise discretion to accept a petition filed more than 2 months after the date of the action or notice from which relief is requested. A deciding official should not accept a petition after the 2-month period without a reason because the 2-month period provides for minimal undue delay in patent prosecution (\"The Office has long considered the two-month period in\u00c2\u00a7 1.181(f)to be the benchmark for determining the timeliness of petitions.\" Changes to Implement the Patent Business Goals, 65 FR 54603, 54646 (September 8, 2000) (citing Changes to Patent Practice and Procedure, 62 FR 53132, 53161 (October 10, 1997))). The deciding official may exercise their discretion to accept an untimely petition beyond the 2-month period in the circumstance that doing so would avoid unnecessary delays in the prosecution of the application. When a petition subject to37 CFR 1.181(f)is filed after the 2-month period from the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested and is accepted at the discretion of the deciding official, the reason for accepting the untimely petition should be articulated in the decision to ensure clarity of the record. The following non-exhaustive factors may be considered to determine whether to accept a petition after the 2-month period:\n\n(1) Petitioner engaged in significant, constructive efforts with the examiner to resolve the issue outside of the petitions process\n\n(2) The examiner agreed, on the written record, to perform an action that would resolve the issue, but failed to do so\n\n(3) A showing of extenuating circumstances, such as delay caused by health, pandemic, natural disaster, etc.",
